XML::Filter::SAXT version 0.01
==============================

DESCRIPTION

SAXT is like the Unix 'tee' command in that it multiplexes the input stream to several output streams. In this case, the
input stream is a PerlSAX event producer (like XML::Parser::PerlSAX) and the output streams are PerlSAX handlers or
filters. 

The SAXT constructor takes a list of hash references. Each hash specifies an output handler. The hash keys can be:
DocumentHandler, DTDHandler, EntityResolver or Handler, where Handler is a combination of the previous three and
acts as the default handler. E.g. if DocumentHandler is not specified, it will try to use Handler. 

INSTALLATION
